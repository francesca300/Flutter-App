Welcome, sir, to the first part of my projectâ€”a web application designed to manage student information.

In this part, you can create, delete, and update student records in the database. The project is divided into three main components:

Backend: Built with Node.js.

Database: Powered by MySQL.

Frontend: Developed using Vue.js.

Getting Started
Install Dependencies:
Make sure all dependencies are installed for both the backend and frontend.

Start the Backend Server:
Navigate to the backend directory and run: nodemon index.js

Start the Frontend Server:
Navigate to the frontend directory and run: npm run serve

I hope you will enjoy this project.I am open to any feedback
