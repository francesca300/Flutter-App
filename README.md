Good morning sir,

Welcome to the second part of my project! In this phase, you can generate a QR code based on the information of a student stored in the database.

Here’s how it works:

Enter the student’s ID.

All the associated information (e.g., name, email, department, etc.) will be displayed.

A QR code containing this information will be generated automatically.
I built an Apk that you can find in build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
NB:This part is connected to the backend in the first part of the project.Make sure your server is running and database are open before running this project.
